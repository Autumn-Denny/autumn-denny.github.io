# FAQ

## How can I participate?

Sign up to attend here, describing your interest in agriculture and technology. After that follow the pre-conference instructions on this page.

## What is the expected time commitment?

You get what you put in. A compelling project will require commitment from all team members, so be prepared to spend most of your work day working on your project.

## Is this mostly hardware, software, or what?

All of the above, but primarily leaning toward the development of information tools. So everything from: new sensors for on-farm data collection, new ways to visualization resource flows, mechanisms to handle data interoperability, to ways to connect existing open source software to support sustainable agricultural practices.


## How do teams work?

You should come with an idea and a team (one or many), but it’s completely ok to switch teams, adjust teams, or even adjust whole ideas once you get here. This is a outcome-focused hackathon – we care only that we make the most compelling stuff for the open-agriculture technology community we possibly can! Here is an example hackathon group formation:

- Problem owner and/or domain expert
- Designer and/or architect
- A couple of developers across the stack
- Maybe a document writers /slide maker / coordinator


## Where do I find out about potential team projects?

We’re asking people with potential project ideas to post their ideas on this GOAT forum post (link is external) so that everyone can start thinking about what teams they’d like to join, and have conversations ahead of time about the ideas. You can also look at the pitch sign-up sheet to see all the titles of projects that will be pitched.

## I don’t code — what about me?

It completely depends on your project. The goal here is to create something compelling to the community. It is entirely possible to create a compelling data schema, or build out a compelling front-end design for a common application. While coding certainly helps, it is not required. Though, as stated before, you do need to have an idea coming in!

## What if I don’t have a team?

If you want to come but don’t have a team or an idea, you are still welcome to register! You will either join an existing team or form a new one with others, we will help facilitate.
